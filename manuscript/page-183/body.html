<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>MENO: Yes.</p><p>SOCRATES: And the women too, Meno, call good men divine&mdash;do they not? and the Spartans, when they praise a good man, say 'that he is a divine man.'</p><p>MENO: And I think, Socrates, that they are right; although very likely our friend Anytus may take offence at the word.</p><p>SOCRATES: I do not care; as for Anytus, there will be another opportunity of talking with him. To sum up our enquiry&mdash;the result seems to be, if we are at all right in our view, that virtue is neither natural nor acquired, but an instinct given by God to the virtuous. Nor is the instinct accompanied by reason, unless there may be supposed to be among statesmen some one who is capable of educating statesmen. And if there be such an one, he may be said to be among the living what Homer says that Tiresias was among the dead, 'he alone has understanding; but the rest are flitting shades'; and he and his virtue in like manner will be a reality among shadows.</p></div> </div>
