<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>MENO: There again, Socrates, your words seem to me excellent.</p><p>SOCRATES: Then, as we are agreed that a man should enquire about that which he does not know, shall you and I make an effort to enquire together into the nature of virtue?</p><p>MENO: By all means, Socrates. And yet I would much rather return to my original question, Whether in seeking to acquire virtue we should regard it as a thing to be taught, or as a gift of nature, or as coming to men in some other way?</p><p>SOCRATES: Had I the command of you as well as of myself, Meno, I would not have enquired whether virtue is given by instruction or not, until we had first ascertained 'what it is.' But as you think only of controlling me who am your slave, and never of controlling yourself,&mdash;such being your notion of freedom, I must yield to you, for you are irresistible.</p></div> </div>
