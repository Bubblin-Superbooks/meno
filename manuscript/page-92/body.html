<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>MENO: Certainly not.</p><p>SOCRATES: You only assert that the round figure is not more a figure than the straight, or the straight than the round?</p><p>MENO: Very true.</p><p>SOCRATES: To what then do we give the name of figure? Try and answer. Suppose that when a person asked you this question either about figure or colour, you were to reply, Man, I do not understand what you want, or know what you are saying; he would look rather astonished and say: Do you not understand that I am looking for the 'simile in multis'? And then he might put the question in another form: Meno, he might say, what is that 'simile in multis' which you call figure, and which includes not only round and straight figures, but all? Could you not answer that question, Meno? I wish that you would try; the attempt will be good practice with a view to the answer about virtue.</p></div> </div>
