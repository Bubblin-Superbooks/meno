<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: Then begin again, and answer me, What, according to you and your friend Gorgias, is the definition of virtue?</p><p>MENO: O Socrates, I used to be told, before I knew you, that you were always doubting yourself and making others doubt; and now you are casting your spells over me, and I am simply getting bewitched and enchanted, and am at my wits' end. And if I may venture to make a jest upon you, you seem to me both in your appearance and in your power over others to be very like the flat torpedo fish, who torpifies those who come near him and touch him, as you have now torpified me, I think. For my soul and my tongue are really torpid, and I do not know how to answer you; and though I have been delivered of an infinite variety of speeches about virtue before now, and to many persons&mdash;and very good ones they were, as I thought&mdash;at this moment I cannot even say what virtue is.</p></div> </div>
