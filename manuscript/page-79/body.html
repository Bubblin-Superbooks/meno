And am I to carry back this report of you to Thessaly?</p><p>SOCRATES: Not only that, my dear boy, but you may say further that I have never known of any one else who did, in my judgment.</p><p>MENO: Then you have never met Gorgias when he was at Athens?</p><p>SOCRATES: Yes, I have.</p><p>MENO: And did you not think that he knew?</p><p>SOCRATES: I have not a good memory, Meno, and therefore I cannot now tell what I thought of him at the time. And I dare say that he did know, and that you know what he said: please, therefore, to remind me of what he said; or, if you would rather, tell me your own view; for I suspect that you and he think much alike.</p></div> </div>
