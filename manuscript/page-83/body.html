Or is the nature of health always the same, whether in man or woman?</p><p>MENO: I should say that health is the same, both in man and woman.</p><p>SOCRATES: And is not this true of size and strength? If a woman is strong, she will be strong by reason of the same form and of the same strength subsisting in her which there is in the man. I mean to say that strength, as strength, whether of man or woman, is the same. Is there any difference?</p></div> </div>
