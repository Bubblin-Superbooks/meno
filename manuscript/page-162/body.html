Let us take another,&mdash;Aristides, the son of Lysimachus: would you not acknowledge that he was a good man?</p><p>ANYTUS: To be sure I should.</p><p>SOCRATES: And did not he train his son Lysimachus better than any other Athenian in all that could be done for him by the help of masters? But what has been the result? Is he a bit better than any other mortal? He is an acquaintance of yours, and you see what he is like. There is Pericles, again, magnificent in his wisdom; and he, as you are aware, had two sons, Paralus and Xanthippus.</p></div> </div>
