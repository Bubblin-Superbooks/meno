<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>MENO: Very true.</p><p>SOCRATES: Then as he is not here, never mind him, and do you tell me: By the gods, Meno, be generous, and tell me what you say that virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge; although I have been just saying that I have never found anybody who had.</p><p>MENO: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering your question. Let us take first the virtue of a man&mdash;he should know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be careful not to suffer harm himself. A woman's virtue, if you wish to know about that, may also be easily described: her duty is to order her house, and keep what is indoors, and obey her husband.</p></div> </div>
