<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Please, Anytus, to help me and your friend Meno in answering our question, Who are the teachers? Consider the matter thus: If we wanted Meno to be a good physician, to whom should we send him? Should we not send him to the physicians?</p><p>ANYTUS: Certainly.</p><p>SOCRATES: Or if we wanted him to be a good cobbler, should we not send him to the cobblers?</p><p>ANYTUS: Yes.</p><p>SOCRATES: And so forth?</p><p>ANYTUS: Yes.</p><p>SOCRATES: Let me trouble you with one more question. When we say that we should be right in sending him to the physicians if we wanted him to be a physician, do we mean that we should be right in sending him to those who profess the art, rather than to those who do not, and to those who demand payment for teaching the art, and profess to teach it to any one who will come and learn? And if these were our reasons, should we not be right in sending him?</p></div> </div>
