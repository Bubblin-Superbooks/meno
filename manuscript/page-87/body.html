<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>MENO: If you want to have one definition of them all, I know not what to say, but that virtue is the power of governing mankind.</p><p>SOCRATES: And does this definition of virtue include all virtue? Is virtue the same in a child and in a slave, Meno? Can the child govern his father, or the slave his master; and would he who governed be any longer a slave?</p><p>MENO: I think not, Socrates.</p><p>SOCRATES: No, indeed; there would be small reason in that. Yet once more, fair friend; according to you, virtue is 'the power of governing;' but do you not add 'justly and not unjustly'?</p></div> </div>
